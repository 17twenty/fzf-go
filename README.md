# FZF #

This is a port of the FZF tool by [JuneGunn](http://github.com/junegunn) set up for use with the gb build tool.

This is vendored and here to make my life easier!

Get started:
```
go get github.com/constabulary/gb/...
git clone https://github.com/17twenty/fzf-go.git
cd fzf-go
gb build
```

You now have your binary in ```$(pwd)/bin/fzf```.
